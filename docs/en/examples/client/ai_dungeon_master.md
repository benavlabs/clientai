## 1. Introduction

ClientAI is a Python package that provides a unified interface for interacting with multiple AI providers. In this tutorial, we'll use ClientAI to create an AI Dungeon Master that can generate story elements, NPC dialogues, and dynamic environments using different AI models.

Our AI Dungeon Master will be a text-based role-playing game (RPG) where the game's content is dynamically generated by AI. This approach allows for infinite replayability and unique experiences for each player.

We'll focus on explaining both technical decisions (such as class structures and AI interactions) and gameplay decisions (like character creation and game mechanics).

The final result is available in [this github repo](https://github.com/igorbenav/clientai-dungeon-master).

## 2. Setting Up the Project

First, let's set up our project and install the necessary dependencies.

1. Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir ai_dungeon_master
cd ai_dungeon_master
```

2. Install ClientAI and its dependencies:

    _If you want to use poetry, you may skip this part._

```bash
pip install clientai[all]
```

This command installs ClientAI with support for all providers. If you only need specific providers, you can install them individually (e.g., `pip install clientai[openai]` for just OpenAI support).

3. Install additional dependencies:

    _If you want to use poetry, you may also skip this part._

We'll need some additional packages for our project.

```bash
pip install requests
```

- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to check if the local AI servers are running.

4. Install Ollama:

Ollama is a local AI model server that we'll use to run the Llama 3 model. Follow these steps to install Ollama:

- For macOS or Linux:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
  ```

- For Windows:
  Download the installer from the [Ollama GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/releases) and follow the installation instructions.

5. Pull the Llama 3 model from Ollama:

After installing Ollama, you need to download the Llama 3 model. Run the following command:

```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

This command will download and set up the Llama 3 model for use with Ollama. The download might take some time depending on your internet connection.

These imports will be used throughout our project:

- `random`: For generating random numbers and making random choices.
- `subprocess`: For starting and managing subprocesses like local AI servers.
- `time`: For adding delays and managing timeouts.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to check server availability.
- `logging`: For logging information and errors.
- `ClientAI`: The main class from the ClientAI package that we'll use to interact with AI providers.

## 2.5 Creating the Project Structure

Before we dive into the code, let's set up a proper project structure. This will help us organize our code and make it easier to maintain and expand in the future.

1. Create the following directory structure:

```
clientai_dungeon_master/
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── .env
└── ai_dungeon_master/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── main.py
    ├── game/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── character.py
    │   ├── game_state.py
    │   └── dungeon_master.py
    ├── ai/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── ai_providers.py
    │   └── ollama_server.py
    └── utils/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── text_utils.py
```

2. Create a `pyproject.toml` file in the root directory with the following content:

    _If you're using pip directly, you may skip this part_

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "clientai-dungeon-master"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "An AI-powered dungeon master for text-based RPG adventures"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]
readme = "README.md"
packages = [{include = "clientai_dungeon_master"}]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
clientai = "^0.1.2"
requests = "^2.32.3"
python-decouple = "^3.8"


[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

and run

```bash
poetry install
```

3. Create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*.pyo
*.pyd
.Python
env/
venv/
ENV/

# Poetry
.venv/
dist/

# Environment variables
.env

# IDEs
.vscode/
.idea/

# Logs
*.log

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
.DS_Store?
._*
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes
ehthumbs.db
Thumbs.db
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
REPLICATE_API_KEY=your_replicate_api_key_here
```

Remember to replace `your_openai_api_key_here` and `your_replicate_api_key_here` with your actual API keys.

5. Move the relevant code into the appropriate files based on the new structure.

This structure separates concerns, making the code more modular and easier to maintain. It also sets up the project for potential future expansion, such as adding more game features or integrating additional AI providers.

## 3. Creating the Game Structure

Before integrating AI, we'll create the basic structure of our game. This includes classes to represent the character, game state, and AI providers.

### Character Class

The `Character` class represents the player's character in the game. It stores essential character information like name, race, class, background story, and stats.

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/game/character.py"
class Character:
    def __init__(self, name: str, race: str, class_type: str, background: str, stats: dict):
        self.name = name
        self.race = race
        self.class_type = class_type
        self.background = background
        self.stats = stats

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Name: {self.name}, Race: {self.race}, Class: {self.class_type}, Background: {self.background}, Stats: {self.stats}"
```

Here we define a character with attributes like a name, race, class, background and stats (like Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom). This is really simple, but will be enough to customize what happens in the story.

We'll also define the `__str__` method to be able to print the character's details easily.

### GameState Class

The `GameState` class keeps track of the game's current state, including the character's status, location, inventory, health, experience, and quests.

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/game/game_state.py"
from typing import Optional

from .character import Character

class GameState:
    def __init__(self, character: Character):
        self.character = character
        self.location = "entrance"
        self.inventory = []
        self.health = 100
        self.experience = 0
        self.quests = []

    def update(self, location: Optional[str] = None, item: Optional[str] = None, health_change: int = 0, exp_gain: int = 0, quest: Optional[str] = None):
        if location:
            self.location = location
        if item:
            self.inventory.append(item)
        self.health = max(0, min(100, self.health + health_change))
        self.experience += exp_gain
        if quest:
            self.quests.append(quest)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{str(self.character)}\nLocation: {self.location}, Health: {self.health}, XP: {self.experience}, Inventory: {', '.join(self.inventory)}, Quests: {', '.join(self.quests)}"
```

We keep track of the state to keep a more consistent experience, we can't expect this to be always generated by the llm. We need to pass the game state as a guide to generate the content.

The update method allows easy updates to the game state, we'll keep health within 0 to 100, and add an inventory and quests to add more depth to the game.


## 4. Integrating Multiple AI Providers

We'll use ClientAI to create a class that manages interactions with different AI providers. This abstraction allows us to switch between providers seamlessly.

### AIProviders Class

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/ai/ai_providers.py"
from typing import List

from clientai import ClientAI

class AIProviders:
    def __init__(self):
        self.openai = ClientAI('openai', api_key=openai_token)
        self.replicate = ClientAI('replicate', api_key=replicate_token)
        self.ollama = ClientAI('ollama', host="http://localhost:11434")

    def chat(
        self,
        messages: List[dict],
        provider: str = 'openai',
        openai_model="gpt-4o-mini",
        replicate_model="meta/meta-llama-3-8b-instruct",
        ollama_model="llama3",
    ):
        if provider == 'openai':
            return self.openai.chat(messages, model=openai_model, stream=True)
        elif provider == 'replicate':
            return self.replicate.chat(messages, model=replicate_model, stream=True)
        elif provider == 'ollama':
            return self.ollama.chat(messages, model=ollama_model, stream=True)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown provider: {provider}")
```

We create instances of ClientAI for each provider with the necessary API keys or host information, then abstract the chat method to allow for easy switching between AI providers.

We are going to use ClientAI to use multiple AI models from different providers, since we want to find what is the best model for each task balancing performance and costs.

### Managing API Keys with python-decouple and a .env File

To securely handle your API keys without exposing them in your codebase, you can use the python-decouple package and store your keys in a .env file. This approach keeps sensitive information out of your code and version control.

1. Install python-decouple:
   _You may skip this if you used poetry_
   
   ```bash
   pip install python-decouple
   ```

2. Create a .env File:
   In your project's root directory, make sure the `.env` has your API keys:

   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   REPLICATE_API_KEY=your_replicate_api_key_here
   ```

   Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` and `your_replicate_api_key_here` with your actual API keys.

3. Ensure .env is added to .gitignore:
   To prevent the .env file from being tracked by version control, ensure it is in your .gitignore file:

   ```plaintext
   # .gitignore
   .env
   ```

   This ensures your API keys remain private and aren't pushed to repositories like GitHub.

4. Access the API Keys in Your Code:
   Import `config` from decouple and retrieve the API keys:

   ```python title="ai_dungeon_master/ai/ai_providers.py"
   from decouple import config

   openai_token = config('OPENAI_API_KEY')
   replicate_token = config('REPLICATE_API_KEY')
   ```

   Now, you can use these variables when initializing your AI providers.

5. Update the AIProviders Class:
   ```python title="ai_dungeon_master/ai/ai_providers.py"
   from typing import List

   from clientai import ClientAI
   from decouple import config

   openai_token = config('OPENAI_API_KEY')
   replicate_token = config('REPLICATE_API_KEY')he ol

   class AIProviders:
       def __init__(self):
           self.openai = ClientAI('openai', api_key=openai_token)
           self.replicate = ClientAI('replicate', api_key=replicate_token)
           self.ollama = ClientAI('ollama', host="http://localhost:11434")

    ...
   ```

### Managing AI Servers

We need to ensure that local AI servers (like Ollama) are running before the game starts, so let's define a function to start ollama.

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/ai/ollama_server.py"
import subprocess
import time
import requests
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def start_ollama_server(timeout: int = 30, check_interval: float = 1.0):
    """
    Start the Ollama server and wait for it to be ready.
    """
    logging.info("Starting Ollama server...")

    try:
        process = subprocess.Popen(
            ['ollama', 'serve'],
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
            text=True
        )
    except subprocess.SubprocessError as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to start Ollama process: {e}")
        raise

    start_time = time.time()
    while time.time() - start_time < timeout:
        try:
            response = requests.get('http://localhost:11434', timeout=5)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                logging.info("Ollama server is ready.")
                return process
        except requests.ConnectionError:
            pass
        except requests.RequestException as e:
            logging.error(f"Unexpected error when checking Ollama server: {e}")
            process.terminate()
            raise

        if process.poll() is not None:
            stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
            logging.error(f"Ollama process terminated unexpectedly. stdout: {stdout}, stderr: {stderr}")
            raise subprocess.SubprocessError("Ollama process terminated unexpectedly")

        time.sleep(check_interval)

    process.terminate()
    raise TimeoutError(f"Ollama server did not start within {timeout} seconds")
```

By managing the server startup within the code, we reduce the setup burden on the player.

## 5. Developing the Enhanced AI Dungeon Master

Now we'll develop the main class that controls the game logic and interactions with AI models.

### EnhancedAIDungeonMaster Class

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/game/dungeon_master.py"
from typing import Tuple, List
import random
import time

from ai.ai_providers import AIProviders
from utils.text_utils import print_separator
from game.character import Character
from game.game_state import GameState

class EnhancedAIDungeonMaster:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ai = AIProviders()
        self.conversation_history = []
        self.game_state = None

    # Methods will be added here...
```

### Creating the Character

We need a method to create the player's character. We'll use AI to do this automatically for us:

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/game/dungeon_master.py"
class EnhancedAIDungeonMaster:
    ...
    def create_character(self):
        print("Let's create your character!")
        name = input("What is your character's name? ")

        # We start by defining a prompt
        character_prompt = f"""
        Create a character for a fantasy RPG with the following details:
        Name: {name}

        Please provide:
        1. A suitable race (e.g., Human, Elf, Dwarf, etc.)
        2. A class (e.g., Warrior, Mage, Rogue, etc.)
        3. A brief background story (2-3 sentences)
        4. Basic stats (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) on a scale of 1-20

        Format the response as follows:
        Race: [race]
        Class: [class]
        Background: [background story]
        Stats:
        - Strength: [value]
        - Dexterity: [value]
        - Constitution: [value]
        - Intelligence: [value]
        - Wisdom: [value]
        - Charisma: [value]
        """

        # And we add this prompt to our chat history
        self.add_to_history("user", character_prompt)
        character_info = self.print_stream(self.ai.chat(self.conversation_history, provider='openai'))

        # Parse the character info
        lines = character_info.strip().split('\n')
        race = class_type = background = ""
        stats = {}

        for line in lines:
            if line.startswith("Race:"):
                race = line.split(": ", 1)[1].strip()
            elif line.startswith("Class:"):
                class_type = line.split(": ", 1)[1].strip()
            elif line.startswith("Background:"):
                background = line.split(": ", 1)[1].strip()
            elif ":" in line and not line.startswith("Stats:"):
                key, value = line.split(":", 1)
                key = key.strip("- ")
                try:
                    stats[key] = int(value.strip())
                except ValueError:
                    stats[key] = random.randint(1, 20)

        # Just in case, let's ensure it'the player has stats
        # If any stat is missing, assign a random value
        for stat in ["Strength", "Dexterity", "Constitution", "Intelligence", "Wisdom", "Charisma"]:
            if stat not in stats:
                stats[stat] = random.randint(1, 20)

        # And let's also ensure other required attributes are assigned
        # If race, class, or background is empty, assign default values
        race = race or "Human"
        class_type = class_type or "Adventurer"
        background = background or "A mysterious traveler with an unknown past."

        return Character(name, race, class_type, background, stats)
```

We'll use GPT 4o mini to create initial stuff we need, like the race, class, background etc, and extract the information from the generated content to handle errors.

Note that since we are leaving this information to the LLM, the name will influence the attributes. If you need a more consistently random generation, do it in the python code and just pass it to the prompt.

### Maintaining Conversation History

To provide context to the AI, we maintain a conversation history.

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/game/dungeon_master.py"
class EnhancedAIDungeonMaster:
    ...
    def add_to_history(self, role: str, content: str):
        if not self.conversation_history or self.conversation_history[-1]['content'] != content:
            self.conversation_history.append({"role": role, "content": content})
            if len(self.conversation_history) > 10:
                self.conversation_history = self.conversation_history[-10:]
```

Here we will ensure we don't add the same message twice. Plus, we are limiting the conversation history to 10 messages to prevent exceeding token limits.

### Generating the Environment

Next, let's create detailed environments to enhance the imersion.

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/game/dungeon_master.py"
class EnhancedAIDungeonMaster:
    ...
    def generate_environment(self):
        if not hasattr(self, 'current_environment'):
            prompt = f"""
            The character {self.game_state.character.name} is a {self.game_state.character.race} {self.game_state.character.class_type} 
            currently in the {self.game_state.location}.

            Describe the current environment in detail, focusing on:
            1. The physical setting and atmosphere
            2. Any notable NPCs present
            3. Interesting objects or features

            Do not create a new character or change any existing character details.
            Do not include any actions or dialogue for {self.game_state.character.name}.

            End your description with one of these tags if appropriate:
            [INTERACT_OPPORTUNITY] - if there's a chance for the player to interact with someone or something
            [QUEST_OPPORTUNITY] - if there's a potential quest or mission available
            """
            self.add_to_history("user", prompt)
            self.current_environment = self.ai.chat(self.conversation_history, provider='openai')
        return self.current_environment
```

Here we instruct the AI to provide specific details, and we use tags for opportunities. We'll parse these tags `INTERACT_OPPORTUNITY` and `QUEST_OPPORTUNITY` later to perform other actions.

We'll also store the environment description to avoid regenerating it unnecessarily.

### Handling Player Actions

Now let's process the player's actions and generate outcomes. We'll run this one locally with ollama.

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/game/dungeon_master.py"
class EnhancedAIDungeonMaster:
    ...
    def handle_player_action(self, action):
        prompt = f"""
        The player ({self.game_state.character.name}, a {self.game_state.character.race} {self.game_state.character.class_type}) 
        attempts to {action} in {self.game_state.location}. 
        Describe the immediate result of this action, focusing on the environment and NPCs' reactions.
        Do not generate any further actions or dialogue for {self.game_state.character.name}.
        If the player is trying to interact with an NPC, end your response with [NPC_INTERACTION: <npc_name>].
        """
        self.add_to_history("user", prompt)
        return self.ai.chat(self.conversation_history, provider='ollama')
```

Here we pass what the player wants to do to the AI and generate the outcomes for the players actions. We are also using a tag here for interactions, so we can process those in a different way.

### Generating NPC Dialogue

Next, let's create a function to generate a dialogue with an npc. We'll use replicate with llama3 8b for this.

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/game/dungeon_master.py"
class EnhancedAIDungeonMaster:
    ...
    def generate_npc_dialogue(self, npc_name: str, player_input: str):
        prompt = f"""
        The player ({self.game_state.character.name}) said to {npc_name}: "{player_input}"
        Generate a single, natural response from {npc_name}, addressing the player's input directly.
        If the player is asking about items for sale, list 2-3 specific items with brief descriptions and prices.
        Do not include any actions or responses from the player character.
        Keep the response concise and relevant to the player's input.
        Do not include any formatting tags, headers, or quotation marks in your response.
        Respond as if you are {npc_name} speaking directly to the player.
        """
        self.add_to_history("user", prompt)
        return self.ai.chat(self.conversation_history, provider='replicate')
```

Note that in the prompt we ensure the AI provides responses that are in character and appropriate, so we can pass this directly to the player.

### Handling Conversations

We manage conversations with NPCs in a separate method. We start with a conversation loop, to allow the player to have a back-and-forth dialogue with an NPC, and we reset the conversation history to focus the AI on the dialogue.

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/game/dungeon_master.py"
class EnhancedAIDungeonMaster:
    ...
    def handle_conversation(self, npc_name):
        print(f"\nYou are now in conversation with {npc_name}.")
        self.conversation_history = [
            {"role": "system", "content": f"You are {npc_name}, speaking directly to the player. Respond naturally and in character."}
        ]
        while True:
            player_input = input(f"\nWhat do you say to {npc_name}? (or type 'end conversation' to stop): ")
            if player_input.lower() == "end conversation":
                print(f"\nYou end your conversation with {npc_name}.")
                break

            print(f"\n{npc_name}:")
            self.print_stream(self.generate_npc_dialogue(npc_name, player_input))
```

We also add the possibility for the player to end the conversation at any time.

### Updating the Game State

We update the game state based on the outcomes provided by the AI.

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/game/dungeon_master.py"
class EnhancedAIDungeonMaster:
    ...
    def update_game_state(self, outcome):
        if "found" in outcome.lower():
            item = outcome.split("found")[1].split(".")[0].strip()
            self.game_state.update(item=item)
        if "new area" in outcome.lower():
            new_location = outcome.split("new area")[1].split(".")[0].strip()
            self.game_state.update(location=new_location)
        if "damage" in outcome.lower():
            self.game_state.update(health_change=-10)
        if "healed" in outcome.lower():
            self.game_state.update(health_change=10)
        if "quest" in outcome.lower():
            quest = outcome.split("quest")[1].split(".")[0].strip()
            self.game_state.update(quest=quest)
        self.game_state.update(exp_gain=5)
```

This is a simpler way to do it, but we will just look for keywords in the AI's response to determine what changes to make. This isn't the most consistent way to do it, but is easy to do and will easily allow the game to respond to the player's actions, making the experience feel more dynamic.

### Processing Story Elements

Let's process the AI-generated story to extract content and any special flags.

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/game/dungeon_master.py"
class EnhancedAIDungeonMaster:
    ...
    def process_story(self, story_generator) -> Tuple[str, List[str]]:
        story = self.print_stream(story_generator, print_output=True)
        story_lines = story.split('\n')

        flags = []
        for line in reversed(story_lines):
            if line.strip().startswith('[') and line.strip().endswith(']'):
                flags.append(line.strip('[').strip(']'))
                story_lines.remove(line)
            else:
                break

        story_content = '\n'.join(story_lines).strip()

        if any(flag.startswith("NPC_INTERACTION:") for flag in flags):
            npc_name = next(flag.split(':')[1].strip() for flag in flags if flag.startswith("NPC_INTERACTION:"))
            return story_content, npc_name
        else:
            return story_content, flags
```

Here is where we'll actually separates the special tags we defined earlier from the story content and ensure the player sees a coherent story without tags.

### Printing Streamed Content

We also don't want to wait until the whole content is generated to print, so let's define a function to display the AI's response in real-time, simulating typing.

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/game/dungeon_master.py"
class EnhancedAIDungeonMaster:
    ...
    def print_stream(self, stream, print_output=True) -> str:
        full_text = ""
        for chunk in stream:
            if print_output:
                print(chunk, end='', flush=True)
            full_text += chunk
            time.sleep(0.03)
        if print_output:
            print()
        return full_text
```

### Main Game Loop

Finally, we bring everything together in the play_game method.

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/game/dungeon_master.py"
class EnhancedAIDungeonMaster:
    ...
    def play_game(self):
        print("Welcome to the Dungeon!")
        character = self.create_character()
        self.game_state = GameState(character)

        print("\nYour adventure begins...")
        while True:
            print_separator()
            environment_description, env_flags = self.process_story(self.generate_environment())

            if "INTERACT_OPPORTUNITY" in env_flags:
                print("\nThere seems to be an opportunity to interact.")
            if "QUEST_OPPORTUNITY" in env_flags:
                print("\nThere might be a quest available.")

            action = input("\nWhat do you do? ")
            if action.lower() == "quit":
                break

            print("\nOutcome:")
            outcome, npc_interaction = self.process_story(self.handle_player_action(action))

            self.update_game_state(outcome)

            if npc_interaction:
                self.handle_conversation(npc_interaction)

            print_separator()
            print(f"Current state: {str(self.game_state)}")

            if self.game_state.health <= 0:
                print("Game Over! Your health reached 0.")
                break

            if hasattr(self, 'current_environment'):
                del self.current_environment
```

The game loop continuously processes player actions and updates the game state, new environments are generated to keep the game dynamic and the player is allowed to quit whenever they want.

Plus, the game is over if health reaches zero.

### Helper Methods

Let's also create some methods for improved user experience, we want to separate content to make it easier to see and also create a print_slowly to simulate streamed content in important messages.

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/utils/text_utils.py"
import time

def print_separator(self):
    print("\n" + "=" * 50 + "\n")

def print_slowly(text, delay=0.03):
    for char in text:
        print(char, end='', flush=True)
        time.sleep(delay)
    print()
```

## 6. Main Script that Runs the Game

At our main script, we initialize and start the game.

```python title="ai_dungeon_master/main.py"
from game.dungeon_master import EnhancedAIDungeonMaster
from utils.text_utils import print_slowly
from ai.ollama_server import start_ollama_server

def main():
    print_slowly("Welcome to the AI Dungeon Master!")
    print_slowly("Prepare for an adventure guided by multiple AI models.")
    print_slowly("Type 'quit' at any time to exit the game.")
    print()

    # Start the Ollama server before the game begins
    ollama_process = start_ollama_server()

    game = EnhancedAIDungeonMaster()
    game.play_game()

    print_slowly("Thank you for playing AI Dungeon Master!")

    # Terminate the Ollama server when the game ends
    if ollama_process:
        ollama_process.terminate()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 7. Running the Game

1. Ensure you're in the root directory of the project.

2. Run the game using Poetry:

```bash
poetry run python ai_dungeon_master/main.py
```

Or directly if you used pip:

```bash
python ai_dungeon_master/main.py
```

This command will execute the `main.py` file, which should contain the game initialization and main loop.
