# Learning Guide Overview

Welcome to the ClientAI Learning Guide! This comprehensive resource is designed to teach you the fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Machine Learning Engineering using practical examples with ClientAI.

## ðŸš§ Under Construction

This learning guide is currently under active development. While we're working hard to create comprehensive content, some sections may be incomplete or pending. We appreciate your patience and encourage you to check back regularly for updates.

## What You'll Learn

This guide will take you through:

- **LLM Fundamentals**: Understanding how large language models work, their capabilities, and how to effectively use them through ClientAI
- **Agent Development**: Learning to build intelligent AI agents that can reason, use tools, and solve complex tasks
- **Retrieval Systems**: Implementing RAG systems to give your applications access to custom knowledge
- **Production Engineering**: Deploying and managing LLM applications in production environments

!!! TIP
    **Looking for Quick Start Instructions?**
